# Memento(Production)

A [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application. User can upload photo through website (should not ultimately in the product) and through iOS app (another repository). Photos are displayed in realtime (pseudo-realtime actually since I have not actually discovered how to make a page automatically refresh. 

Deploy using forever `sudo npm install -g forever`.
## Todo
1. Add flash popups for upload success. [See this tutorial](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25350841/sails-js-flash-message-for-user-registration)

2. Enable CSRF Protection
3. Set up database
4. Enable SSL
